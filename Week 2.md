The internet is a collection of various technologies that work together, the first of these technologies is packet switching. In 1958 Paul Baran was trying to make a very resilient communications system. He and colleague named Donald Davies came up with packet switching which is data being broken up into pieces and remade at its target location. 
     The 2nd technology is the modem. Modems allow computer data to be transported over the telephone line but only large corporations had access to modems. In 1977 Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington created the first in-home modem, eventually, they made a business based on modems. In 1981 they came out with modems that could be used on any computer because it was able to send info and interpret Info as commands. That modem is the basis for modern modems used today. 
     The 3rd technology is the Internet protocol suite. Robert Kahn wanted to join various networks together and to this, he had to make a list of commands called a protocol. As more networks were connected the protocols got more complicated and required the use of multiple types of protocols that became known as TCP/IP. 
     In combination, these innovations were the building blocks of the internet that we have today.
