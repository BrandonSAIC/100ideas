1.A flame war is an argument on the internet that devolves into insulting each other in various ways. In 1982 when emoticons were initially being used they used them to indicate but when people didn’t understand the emoticons a flame war could occur. 

2.According to Encyclopedia Brittanica Emoticons are “punctuation marks, letters, and numbers used to create pictorial icons that generally display an emotion or sentiment” While emojis in today’s age are small images used instead of text. 

3.Lossy compression is a technique that reduces file size by deleting extra pieces of data in the file, some of this extra data could be decreasing the number of color variations in the image. PNG, GIF, TIFF are also pretty common image file formats that compress images. The PNG file format compresses images by deleting identical strings of data and changing common symbols with shorter versions. GIF compression is very similar to PNG compression but GIF’s 256 color limit allows it files to pretty small.

4.There many types of metadata that I didn’t think were metadata, one example being structural metadata which can be things like the table of contents and page numbers in a book. Another example is the metadata in emails like who sent and received the mail, the date, and how the mail was encrypted.
